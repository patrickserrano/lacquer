title: Skills catalog
description: Every skill shipped by core and each profile, and when it fires.
---

Skills are Claude Code `SKILL.md` files synced into a project's `.claude/skills/`.
`core` skills apply everywhere; profile skills only reach projects with that
profile enabled. Source lives at `core/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` or
`profiles/<profile>/skills/<name>/SKILL.md` in the lacquer repo.

Skills marked **original** were authored directly in this repo. Everything
else was vendored (copied in, then adapted to this repo's conventions) from a
named upstream — see [Notes on vendored skills](#notes-on-vendored-skills)
below each table for anything a short link can't capture.

## core

| Skill | Fires when | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `advisor-checkpoint` | Consulting a stronger model mid-task for a second opinion — stuck, before committing to an approach, or before declaring a non-trivial task done. | original |
| `caveman` | User says "caveman mode", "less tokens", "be brief", or invokes `/caveman` — token-efficient terse replies. | [ios-template](https://github.com/patrickserrano/ios-template) (private) |
| `claude-rescue` | Running under Codex CLI, stuck, and wanting a second opinion from Claude Code via a real subprocess — forwards the task and returns its output verbatim. | [openai/codex-plugin-cc](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc/blob/main/plugins/codex/agents/codex-rescue.md) (`codex-rescue`, reversed) |
| `evaluator-optimizer` | Generate a solution, evaluate against explicit pass/fail criteria, refine, repeat until it passes or a round cap is hit. | original |
| `github-ci-fix` | PR checks fail, CI is red, or a GitHub Actions workflow breaks — inspects failing checks via `gh`, pulls logs, scopes external checks, builds a fix plan. | [ios-template](https://github.com/patrickserrano/ios-template) (private) |
| `github-issue-fix-flow` | Given a GitHub issue number: implement a fix, run builds/tests, commit with a closing message, push. | [ios-template](https://github.com/patrickserrano/ios-template) (private) |
| `manager-loop` | Running a large batch of independent work items (fleet-wide harvest, multi-repo sync-down, overnight backlog) as a persistent coordinator. | original |
| `nameplate-attention` | Grabbing the human's attention (topmost message card + pulsating screen borders) before a password-manager prompt or whenever blocked on them. | [steipete/nameplate](https://github.com/steipete/nameplate/blob/main/skills/nameplate-attention/SKILL.md) |
| `security-review` | Adversarial security review of a branch diff, PR, or working tree before merge. | original |
| `skill-authoring-standard` | Writing or reviewing a `SKILL.md` — the bar it must clear: tight trigger-oriented frontmatter, single responsibility, no padding. | original |

## ios

Most of this profile was absorbed from `patrickserrano/ios-template` (a
private predecessor repo) in one migration; several of *those* skills turned
out to themselves be vendored from public, per-topic "Agent Skill" repos by
[AvdLee](https://github.com/AvdLee) (Antoine van der Lee — SwiftLee). See the
notes below the table.

#### Notes on vendored skills

- `swift-concurrency` is also based on Antoine van der Lee's paid [Swift
  Concurrency Course](https://www.swiftconcurrencycourse.com) — the skill
  body itself only carries a plain-text attribution line, no link:
  commit `a228d797` deliberately scrubbed `swiftconcurrencycourse.com`/UTM
  links from the *synced* skill to avoid shipping course marketing
  fleet-wide. That decision stands here too — see the git history rather
  than expecting a link inside the skill.
- `rocketsim` also *integrates with* the third-party [RocketSim](https://www.rocketsim.app)
  app itself (paid, not bundled) — distinct from the skill's own source above.
- `swiftui-liquid-glass` additionally cites Apple's WWDC25 session 323 for
  one design note.

## supabase

| Skill | Fires when | Source |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| `supabase-postgres-best-practices` | Writing, reviewing, or optimizing Postgres queries, schema, indexing, connection pooling, RLS policies, or locking. | [supabase/agent-skills](https://github.com/supabase/agent-skills/tree/main/skills/supabase-postgres-best-practices) (official, MIT) |

## Third-party skills

Not this repo's own skills — installed per-project via `[project].skills` in
`.lacquer.toml` and `lacquer skills` (see the [README](https://github.com/patrickserrano/lacquer#third-party-skills)
for the mechanism). Listed here so the packages this fleet actually pulls in
have a source link.

**[dpearson2699/swift-ios-skills](https://github.com/dpearson2699/swift-ios-skills)**
— Apple-framework reference skills. `lacquer init` suggests these automatically
from a component's Swift imports (see `internal/skillsuggest`); this table is
that same mapping.

**[HunterHillegas/mac-assed-mac-app-skill](https://github.com/HunterHillegas/mac-assed-mac-app-skill)**
— AppKit/macOS app conventions. Not import-suggested (no single Swift import
signals a macOS app); declared explicitly where needed (e.g. windsock).
