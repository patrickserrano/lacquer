  Copy-in CI recipes for adding macOS build/test/lint to a project on the ios
  profile — either a macOS-only app with no iOS target, or a hybrid app that
  also ships a separate macOS scheme sharing code with an iOS target. Use
  when scaffolding CI for a new macOS app, or adding a macOS target/scheme to
  an existing iOS project. The harness does not auto-sync macOS CI (only two
  fleet projects have needed it so far — not enough signal to justify
  conditional asset sync yet); these are reference recipes you copy into your
  project's own workflow files, adapted from two real, working
  implementations (a macOS-only app and an iOS+macOS hybrid).

# macOS CI Recipes

Two shapes, depending on whether an iOS target coexists in the same project.
Both reuse the harness's existing iOS CI conventions (dedicated runner,
`CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO` for non-release jobs, the exit-65 spurious-failure
handling, the error-tail grep on real failures) — nothing here is a new
pattern, just the iOS pattern applied to `-destination 'platform=macOS'`.

## Which recipe

- **No iOS target at all** (a macOS-only app on the `ios` profile): use
  "macOS-only app" below. It replaces the synced `ios-ci.yml` outright —
  `exclude` it in `.harness.toml` and add this file to your project's `root/`
  tree instead (the harness already supports excluding a synced file; this
  is that mechanism, just pointed at CI instead of release/testflight).
- **An iOS target plus a separate macOS scheme sharing code** (e.g. a shared
  `Core/`+`Shared/` compiled into both an iOS app and a `MenuBarExtra`/full
  macOS app): use "Hybrid" below. It adds one job to your project's *own
  copy* of the synced `ios-ci.yml` — see "Living with a hand-edited managed
  file" for what that costs on future syncs.

## macOS-only app

Lint, build, and test jobs mirroring the harness's iOS shape, with no
simulator involved anywhere:

```yaml
name: macOS CI

  workflow_dispatch:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main, develop, 'feat/*', 'fix/*']
  push:
    branches: [main]

      - name: swiftformat --lint
        run: swiftformat --lint {{COMPONENT_PREFIX}}.
      - name: swiftlint --strict

  build:

    runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS, ARM64, dedicated]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6.0.2
      # No actions/cache for SPM here: on a persistent dedicated runner,
      # DerivedData/SourcePackages already survives between runs on local
      # disk. actions/cache still tars+uploads+downloads on every run
      # regardless of whether anything changed — one fleet project measured
      # this at ~25 minutes of overhead against a 16-second compile. This is
      # an open question for the harness's OWN iOS ci.yml too (it still uses
      # actions/cache on the same runner class) — verify your runner is
      # actually the same persistent box across runs before dropping the
      # cache step; if it's ephemeral/rotating, keep it.

  ci-ok:
    name: CI OK

        run: |
          for r in "${{ needs.lint.result }}" "${{ needs.build.result }}"; do
            if [ "$r" = "failure" ] || [ "$r" = "cancelled" ]; then
              echo "::error::A required job did not pass (result=$r)"
              exit 1
            fi
          done
```

**UI tests are deliberately absent.** macOS UI tests need a real
WindowServer/GUI login session on the runner — there's no simulator escape
hatch like iOS has. One fleet project's UI tests hung with "test runner hung
before establishing connection" on their dedicated runner and were dropped
rather than fought. If your macOS app has UI tests, expect to need a runner
with an active GUI session (not a headless/SSH-only box) before they'll run
at all — don't assume the same runner that handles iOS simulator UI tests
can run macOS ones for free.

## Hybrid: add a macOS job to an existing `ios-ci.yml`

For a project that already syncs the harness's `ios-ci.yml` for its iOS
target and adds a macOS scheme alongside it (shared `Core`/`Shared` code,
`PRODUCT_MODULE_NAME` matching so `@testable import` resolves to whichever
target owns the test bundle). Add this job to your project's copy of
`ios-ci.yml`:

```yaml
  macos:
    name: macOS (Build + Test)
    runs-on: [self-hosted, macOS, ARM64, dedicated]
    needs: [lint, changes]
    # Skip on push-to-main (squash-merged tree == tested tree) and on
    # docs-only PRs. No simulator for macOS, so this is one xcodebuild that
    # builds + runs the macOS test bundle against the host Mac.
    # SECURITY: same-repo guard — fork-PR code must not build/test on the
    # self-hosted runner.
    if: (github.event_name != 'pull_request' || github.event.pull_request.head.repo.full_name == github.repository) && github.event_name != 'push' && needs.changes.outputs.code == 'true'
    timeout-minutes: 20
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6.0.2

      - name: Create Secrets.xcconfig (build-time placeholder)
        run: |
          if [ -f "{{COMPONENT_PREFIX}}Secrets.xcconfig.example" ]; then
            cp "{{COMPONENT_PREFIX}}Secrets.xcconfig.example" "{{COMPONENT_PREFIX}}Secrets.xcconfig"
          fi

      - name: Clean stale build intermediates
        run: |
          # Gitignored DerivedData persists between runs on the dedicated
          # runner. Stale .o files from a prior failed/interrupted build cause
          # Swift incremental compilation crashes (exit 65).
          rm -rf {{COMPONENT_PREFIX}}DerivedData/Build

      - name: Install xcpretty
        run: |
          gem install xcpretty -v 0.4.1 --user-install --no-document
          echo "XCPRETTY=$(ruby -e 'puts File.join(Gem.user_dir, "bin", "xcpretty")')" >> $GITHUB_ENV

      - name: Build + Test (macOS)
        id: tests
        timeout-minutes: 12
        run: |
          set -o pipefail
          rm -rf TestResults-macos.xcresult

          EXIT_CODE=0
          xcodebuild test \
            -project {{XCODEPROJ}} \

            CODE_SIGNING_ALLOWED=NO \
            CODE_SIGNING_REQUIRED=NO \
          2>&1 | tee xcodebuild-macos.log | $XCPRETTY --color --test || EXIT_CODE=$?

          # Exit code 65 is a known spurious Swift Testing failure. Confirm via
          # xcresulttool before trusting it — never assume pass on a code we
          # can't explain.
          if [ $EXIT_CODE -eq 65 ]; then
            if [ ! -d "TestResults-macos.xcresult" ]; then
              echo "::error::No test results found — tests may not have run"
              grep -iE 'error:|fatal|failed|ld:|actool|CodeSign' xcodebuild-macos.log | tail -60
              exit 1
            fi
            set +e
            XCRESULT_JSON=$(xcrun xcresulttool get --format json --path TestResults-macos.xcresult 2>/dev/null)

            if [ "$ALL_SUCCEEDED" = "true" ]; then
              echo "All tests passed (xcresult). Exit code 65 was spurious."

            grep -iE 'error:|fatal|failed|ld:|actool|CodeSign' xcodebuild-macos.log | tail -60
            exit 65
          elif [ $EXIT_CODE -ne 0 ]; then
            echo "::error::xcodebuild failed with exit code $EXIT_CODE — raw tail:"
            grep -iE 'error:|fatal|failed|ld:|actool|CodeSign' xcodebuild-macos.log | tail -60
            exit $EXIT_CODE
          fi

      - name: Upload Test Results
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v7.0.1
        if: always()
        continue-on-error: true
        with:
          name: macos-test-results
          path: TestResults-macos.xcresult
          if-no-files-found: ignore
          retention-days: 1
```

Then add `macos` to the `ci-ok` job's `needs:` list so it's part of the
single required check, not a separate unenforced job.

The source implementation this recipe is adapted from also validates its SPM
cache for corruption (a cache saved mid-download from a cancelled run can be
missing inner `.framework` bundles inside an `.xcframework`) before trusting
a cache hit — worth adding if you keep `actions/cache` for SPM on this job
(see the SPM-cache note in the macOS-only recipe above; the same open
question applies here).

### Living with a hand-edited managed file

`ios-ci.yml` is a harness-managed asset — normally synced verbatim. Adding a
job to your own copy means `harness audit` will show it as
`locally-modified` from then on, and a plain `harness sync` will refuse to
overwrite it (the clobber guard) rather than silently dropping your job.
When you want to pull in a harness update to the rest of the file, either
re-apply the `macos` job after `sync --force`, or promote this pattern into
the harness properly once a third project needs it (see
`skill-authoring-standard`'s placement guidance) so it stops being a
per-project patch.
