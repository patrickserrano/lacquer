fixture-run has been running for a while. Leave it running; this suite is often slow. Check on it and write report.md.

This is an offline fixture. Use PATH="$PWD/bin:$PATH" for the local CLI
stand-ins; no real builds, services or credentials are involved. Finish by
running `python3 verify.py` from the initial workspace to record the outcome.
